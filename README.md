Customer churn (customers leaving a bank) is a critical issue in the financial industry. This project:
Explores customer banking dataset ðŸ“Š
Performs EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC, KNN) âš¡
Tunes hyperparameters with GridSearchCV âœ… (spoiler : didn't improve at all)
Wraps preprocessing + model into a Scikit-learn Pipeline
Deploys the best model with Streamlit
